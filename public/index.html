<h3>The day I had the most fun</h3>
    <p>I think that the day that I had the most fun was when I went to Wild Waves
    theme park with my mom's whole side of the family when I was in seventh grade.
    I got to hang out with all of my cousins and go on a lot of rides with them.
    We were there from the time that it opened to the time that it closed, so we
    even managed to ride on <strong>every</strong> ride (that was open) in the entire park
    that day. Our strategy was to do all of the water slides and wet rides first
    because there were less of those type of rides. After eating lunch and getting
    time to dry off, we switched to doing all of the dry rides. After we left, we all went to Red
    Robin's for dinner and I ate so many french fries that I almost got sick.</p>
